1) Install Docker 
	docker install ubuntu 

2) Create a Docker hub account 
	Login to your hub account  in the host machine 
		docker login 

3) Pull and try a sample image 
	a. docker pull ubuntu 
	b. docker pull jenkins/jenkins:lts

4) List the existing local images 
	docker images 

5) Try to create a container out of pulled image
	a. docker run -it -d ubuntu /bin/bash 
	b. create a directory /home/ubuntu/jenkins_home with 777 permission and run below command 
	c. docker run -it -d --name jenkins -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v /home/ubuntu/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts

6) List containers 
	docker ps 
		(or)
	docker container ls 

7) To get Jenkins admin password 
	docker logs <container_id / container_name> 
	ex: docker logs jenkins 


Docker 
	Docker is one of the tools that used the idea of the isolated resources to 
	create a container that allows applications to be packaged with all the 
	dependencies installed and ran wherever we wanted.
	
	Docker can only run on Linux machines this means I cant install Docker directly on Windows or any other OS.
	If I want install Docker on windows then I need to run a Linux VM in windows on top that I need to run Docker.

Virtualization (VM)
	- VM is way of running virtual OS on top a host OS using a special software called Hypervisor.
	- VM directly shares the hardware of the host OS. 

					VM 					vs 			Containerisation 
	1. Virtualization at hardware level  		1. Virtualization at OS level 
	2. Heavyweight - consume more host 		2. Lightweight
	   resources 	
	3. VM uses hypervisor 				3. containerisation tool is used 
	4. limited performance - Boot up time           4. Native performance - usually boot 
		is more which is in minutes 	           fast in seconds.
	5. Consumes more storage 		        5. Shares OS storage means only uses 
							   required storage.
	6. Supports all OS 				6. Supports on Linux

host machine 
	This is the machine in which docker is running

Kubernetes - k8s 
The architecture of k8s differs from master and worker node 

	Master node components 
		1. Api Server / kube-api-server
			- It is the main management point of the cluster and also called 
			  as brain of the cluster.
			- All the components are directly connected to API serve, they 
			  communicate through API server only and no other component will 
			  communicate directly with each other.
			- This is the only component which connects and got access to etcd.
			- All the cluster requests are authenticated and authorised by API server.
			- API server has a watch mechanism for watching the changes in cluster.
			
		2. etcd 
			- ectd is a distributed , consistent key value store used for 
			  storing the complete cluster information/data.
			- ectd contains data such as configuration management of cluster,
              distributed work and basically complete cluster information.			
			
		3. scheduler / kube-scheduler
			- The scheduler always watches for a new pod request and 
			  decides which worker node this pod should be created.
			- Based on the worker node load, affinity and anti-affiny, taint configuration 
			  pod will be scheduled to a particular node.
			  
		Controller manager /control manager / kube-controller 
			- It is a daemon that always runs and embeds core control loops known as controllers. 
			- K8s has some inbuild controllers such as Deployment, DaemonSet, ReplicaSet, Replication controller,
			  node controller, jobs, cronjob, endpoint controller, namespace controller etc.	
			
		Cloud controller manager 
			- These controller help us to connect with the public cloud provider service and this component 
			  is maintained by cloud providers only.

Worker node components 
		kubelet 
			- It is an agent that runs on each and every worker node and it alsways watches the API 
			  server for pod related changes running in its worker node.
			- kubelet always make sure that the assigend pods to its worker node is running.
			- kubelet is the one which communicates with containarisation tool (docker daemon)
              		  through docker API (CRI). 	
			- work of kubelet is to create and run the pods. Always reports the status of the worker node 
			  and each pod to API server. (uses a tool call cAdvisor)
			- Kubelet is the one which runs probes.	
		
		kube service proxy 
			(in k8s service means networking)
			- Service proxy runs on each and every worker node and is responsble for watching API 
			  server for any changes in service configuration (any network related configuration).	
			- Based on the configuration service proxy manages the entire network of worker node.

		Container runtime interface (CRI)
			- This component initialy identifies the container technology and connects it to kubelet.
			
		pod
			- pods are the smallest deployable object in kuberntes.
			- pod should contain atleast one container and can have n number of containers.
			- If pod contains more than one container all the container share the same memory assigned to that pod.

Linux namespaces and cgroups 
	namespaces 


YAML syntax 
 - filetype .yaml or .yml
 - YAML consists of key - value pairs 
 - Key is always defined by the tool - k8s 
 - Values will be defined by user.
 		Types of values we can provide 
 			- Integer (Numeric)
 			- Sting (Alphanumeric)
 			- Array 
 			- List 
 			- Boolean 

 	List 
 		name: Harsha
 		hobbies: ["Reaading", "Coding", "Driving"]

 		 			(OR)

 		name: Harsha
 		hobbies: 
 			- Driving 
 			- Reading 
 			- Coding  					


apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
         - containerPort: 8080
       - containerPort: 50000
   

	apiVersion: v1
		- This is the version of api used to create a k8s object.
		- The fields are case-sensitive and YAML use camelcase.
		- The type of api are alpha, beta and stable.
		
	kind: Pod
		- here we specify which object we need to create. 
		- Always object name first letter is capital.
		
	metadata:
	    - This field is used to provide information on the object 
		  which we are creating.
		- Information such as name, labels and annotations. 	
	
	spec:
		- This is used to do the actual configuration of the 
		  object.

		 ports: 
		    - containerPort: 80	


To create / apply a configuration 
	kubectl apply -f <file>.yml	
	
To list objects 
	kubectl get <object_type>
		ex: List pods - kubectl get pods 
		    List deployment - kubectl get deployments
			
To delete objects 
	kubectl delete <object_type>

Deployment controller / Deployment / Deployment k8s
	- Deployment is used to create replicas of similar kind of pods and It makes sure that at a given point 
	  of time that number of replicas of pods is always running by using ReplicaSet controller.
	- If we update the configuration of deployment, it will automatically updates in all the pod replicas.
	- Rollout and Rollback of pod update is possible. We can use different deployment strategy for update,
	  by default it uses RollingUpdate. 
		Other strategies: canary, Recreate, Ramped and Blue-Green 
	- we can pause the deployment whenever we need.
	- Deployment internally got its own autoscaler which is of type horizontal smaller (hap).
	 
	  RollingUpdate	
		MaxSurge 
		  - Specifies the maximum number of pods the Deployment is allowed to create at one time. 
		  - You can specify this as a whole number (e.g. 5), or as a percentage of the total required number of pods 		
		         (e.g. 10%, always rounded up to the next whole number). 
		  - If you do not set MaxSurge, the implicit, default value is 25%.
		
		MaxUnavailable 
		  - specifies the maximum number of pods that are allowed to be unavailable during the rollout. 
		  - Like MaxSurge, you can define it as an absolute number or a percentage. 
	
	To scale up and scale down 
		1. We can update the replicas count in spec / configuration / yaml file.
		2. We can use kubectl cli 
			kubectl scale deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment --replicas=10

	To autoscale 
		1. kubectl autoscale deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment --min=5 --max=10 --cpu-percent=80

	deployment = pod + ReplicaSet + autoscalling + RollingUpdate + scale 

Labels, selector and annotations
	Labels:
		- K8S labels are provided as metadata key value to identify the object.
		- We can provide labels to any object in K8S
		- Labels are used to identify by selectors
		- We can have same label on multiple objects and 	

		To list labels of any object 
			kubectl get <object_type> <object_name> --show-labels	

	Selectors:
		- Selectors are used to select, filter and identify the labeled objects.

		Types of selectors 
			equality-based 
				- In this selector we can use only one operator which is equal_to (=, ==) or (!=) not_equal
				- It looks for exact match for the label  

				app = nginx  or app: nginx
				app != nginx

			set-based 
				- This type of selector allows to filter objects based on multiple set of values to a key.
				- operators that are supported are in , notin and exists

				app in (nginx, nginx1)
				app exists (nginx, nginx1)
				app notin (nginx, nginx1)

ReplicaSet vs Replication controller
	- Both ensures that at a given point of time the specified number of replicas are always running.
	- Replication controller is very old controller now it is replaced by ReplicaSet.
	- The only difference between them is Replication controller supports only equality-based selector but 
	  ReplicaSet support both set-based and equality based selector.

DaemonSet 
	- DaemonSet creates exactly one pod on each and every worker node in the cluster and ensures that all that are 
	  always running.
    - If a new worker node is added or deleted, DaemonSet will also add or delete the pod from the 
	  respective worker node.

Service (svc) (Basic network configurations in k8s)
	- Service is an REST api objects with which we can define policies to access set of pods.
	- Service are cluster level object.
	- By default, services are loadbalancers.
	- K8S Preffered port range for services is between 30000 - 50000.  
	
	ClusterIP
		- This is the default type of service in k8S.
		- using ClusterIP we can expose the IPs of pods to another set of pods with in the cluster.

		To check 
			1. Create a custom images and push to your Docker registry
				docker build -t <username>/<repo_name>:<tag> .
				docker login
				docker push 
			2. kubectl apply -f clusterIP.yml

			3. Login to any one pod
					kubectl exec -it <pod_name> /bin/bash

			4. Try to access the service - ClusterIP using <ClusterIP_ip_address>:<service_port>		 	
				curl </ClusterIP_ip_address>:<service_port>
				ex: (for i in {1..20}; do curl 10.101.209.36:30002; echo; done)

	NodePort
		- This service is most primitive way to get the external traffic directed to our applications 
		  running inside the cluster in pods.
		- Automatically a ClusterIP will also be created internally.

		NodePort = ClusterIP + a port mapping to the all the nodes ips. 		

		- If we wont specify any port while creating nodeport, k8s will Automatically asigns a random port 
		  between 30000 - 32767

namespaces (ns)
	- k8s namespaces is a way of applying abstraction / isolation to support multiple 
	  virtual clusters of k8s objects with in the same physical cluster.
	- Each and every object in k8s must be in a namespace.
	- If we wont specify namespace, objects will be created in default namespace of k8s.
    - namespaces are cluster level.
	- Namespace are only hidden from each other but not fully isolated because one 
	  service in a namespace can talk to another service in another namespace using 
	  fullname (service/<service_name>) followed by namespace name
	
	usage: we can apply environment based logical separation on cluster. 
		
	Type of deafault NS
	1. default
	   - This NS is used for all the objects which are not belongs to any other namespace.
	   - If we wont specify any namespace while creating an object in k8s then 
         that object will be created in deafult namespace.
			
	2. kube-system 
	   - This namespace is always used for objects created by the k8s system.
	   
	3. kube-public 
	   - The objects in this namespace are available or accessable to all.
       - All the objects in this namespace are made public.

	4. kube-node-lease 
	   - This namespace holds lease objects assosiated with each node.
	   - Node lease allows the kubelet to send heartbeats so that the control palne can 
		 detect node failure.

	To list namespaces 
		kubectl get namespaces 
		kubectl get ns	

	To list object in a namespace 
		kubectl get -n <namespace_name> <object_type>
	
	To list objects in all namespaces
		kubectl get --all-namespaces <object_type>
		kubectl get -A <object_type>

	To create a namespace 
		kubectl create ns <namespace_name>
		
	To create a object in a namespace 
		1. In metadata:
			namespace: <namespace_name>

		2. While apply 	
			kubectl apply -f <spec_file>.yml -n <namespace_name> 

		Note: If we provide namespace in both spec file and while apply, 
		      apply command check and compares the namespace in spec file if they are not same k8s won't 
		      allow us to create the object.	

Statefull Applications 
	- User session data is saved at the server side.
	- if server goes down, it is difficult to transfer the session data to other server. 
	- This type of application will not work, if we want to implement autoscaling.
	
Stateless Applications
	- user session-data is never saved at the server side.
	- using a common authentication gateway / client token method to validate the users 
	  once for multiple microservices.	
		
Monolothic and Microservice architecture 

	Monolothic architecture
		- A monolothic application has a single code base with multiple modules in it.
		- It is a single build for entire application.
		- To make minor changes to application, we need to re-build and re-deploy the 
		  complete application.
		- scaling is very challenging.
			
	Microservice architecture 
		- A microservice application is composed of small (micro) services. 
		- Each service will have a different code base.
		- Application are divided into as small as possible sub applications called services
		  which are independent to each other which are called loosely coupled.	
		- Each service can be managed separately and it is deployable separately.
		- Services need not to share same technology stack or frameworks.

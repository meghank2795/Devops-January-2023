Kubernetes - k8s 
The architecture of k8s differs from master and worker node 

	Master node components 
		1. Api Server / kube-api-server
			- It is the main management point of the cluster and also called 
			  as brain of the cluster.
			- All the components are directly connected to API serve, they 
			  communicate through API server only and no other component will 
			  communicate directly with each other.
			- This is the only component which connects and got access to etcd.
			- All the cluster requests are authenticated and authorised by API server.
			- API server has a watch mechanism for watching the changes in cluster.
			
		2. etcd 
			- ectd is a distributed , consistent key value store used for 
			  storing the complete cluster information/data.
			- ectd contains data such as configuration management of cluster,
              distributed work and basically complete cluster information.			
			
		3. scheduler / kube-scheduler
			- The scheduler always watches for a new pod request and 
			  decides which worker node this pod should be created.
			- Based on the worker node load, affinity and anti-affiny, taint configuration 
			  pod will be scheduled to a particular node.
			  
		Controller manager /control manager / kube-controller 
			- It is a daemon that always runs and embeds core control loops known as controllers. 
			- K8s has some inbuild controllers such as Deployment, DaemonSet, ReplicaSet, Replication controller,
			  node controller, jobs, cronjob, endpoint controller, namespace controller etc.	
			
		Cloud controller manager 
			- These controller help us to connect with the public cloud provider service and this component 
			  is maintained by cloud providers only.

Worker node components 
		kubelet 
			- It is an agent that runs on each and every worker node and it alsways watches the API 
			  server for pod related changes running in its worker node.
			- kubelet always make sure that the assigend pods to its worker node is running.
			- kubelet is the one which communicates with containarisation tool (docker daemon)
              		  through docker API (CRI). 	
			- work of kubelet is to create and run the pods. Always reports the status of the worker node 
			  and each pod to API server. (uses a tool call cAdvisor)
			- Kubelet is the one which runs probes.	
		
		kube service proxy 
			(in k8s service means networking)
			- Service proxy runs on each and every worker node and is responsble for watching API 
			  server for any changes in service configuration (any network related configuration).	
			- Based on the configuration service proxy manages the entire network of worker node.

		Container runtime interface (CRI)
			- This component initialy identifies the container technology and connects it to kubelet.
			
		pod
			- pods are the smallest deployable object in kuberntes.
			- pod should contain atleast one container and can have n number of containers.
			- If pod contains more than one container all the container share the same memory assigned to that pod.

Linux namespaces and cgroups 
	namespaces 


YAML syntax 
 - filetype .yaml or .yml
 - YAML consists of key - value pairs 
 - Key is always defined by the tool - k8s 
 - Values will be defined by user.
 		Types of values we can provide 
 			- Integer (Numeric)
 			- Sting (Alphanumeric)
 			- Array 
 			- List 
 			- Boolean
